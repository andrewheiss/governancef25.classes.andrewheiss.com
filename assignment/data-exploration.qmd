## Instructions

Use data from the [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/), [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/), [Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project](https://www.v-dem.net/), or [Quality of Governance (QoG) project](https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government/qog-data) to compare some aspect of the public sector across five countries. These data sources include information about public sector labor force participation, gender proportions in bureaucracy, civil society openness and restrictions, human resource management policies, and a host of other public policy and management issues.

You will select **one public sector issue** and **five countries** and collect the relevant data on the issue for **at least the past ten years** (if available). You will then summarize and visualize trends in the data and draw conclusions about the issue in these countries. You will conclude with a discussion of what the trends in these five countries might mean for the public sector in other countries. 

Your essay should be a minimum of **1,250 words**. Broadly speaking, your essay should include:

- A justification and summary of your chosen issue area and data source—why does it matter, and why should we care about what it looks like around the world?
- A justification for your five chosen countries—why these? are they representative of general regime types or regions?
- A graph and/or table showing changes in your chosen measure over the past decade
- A discussion and speculation of why the measure has changed over time—try connecting changes to political changes, civil conflicts, or economic developments
- A discussion of what these trends might mean for the public sector more globally

You will submit this essay via iCollege.

## Plotting QoG data with Excel

The detailed country-year data from QoG, V-Dem, the World Bank, and other sources is structured in a way that makes it easy to work with statistical software like R and Stata. However, with the knowledge of some extra features (like filtering and data querying) it's possible to work with it using Excel.

In the example below, we'll create a chart of the number of government officials with a military title (`wgov_totmil`) from the QoG project. Don't use that indicator for your essay—this is just to show the general process.

### Get the data

1. Go to the [QoG Standard Dataset](https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government/qog-data/data-downloads/standard-dataset) webpage.

2. In the navigation bar on the right of the page, download the CSV file for the **Time-Series data** (the Cross-Section data is for only one year).

3. In the navigation bar on the right of the page, download the codebook as well. You'll need to refer to this to see what columns you might want to work with.

### Import the data into Excel

The QoG's standard time series CSV file is 70+ MB large. You can open it directly in Excel if you want, but it'll be slow and a little unwieldy—it has nearly 2,000 columns and more than 15,000 rows!

A better approach is to *import* a subset of the data into Excel and work with that instead. Using Excel's "Power Query" feature, you can import only the columns and rows that you are interested in and ignore everything else.

1. Open a new Excel workbook.

2. In the Data tab in the menu ribbon, select "Get Data". This lets you connect Excel to a bunch of different types of data sources. You want to connect Excel to the big QoG CSV file you just downloaded.

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   On macOS, click on the "Get Data" button, then select "Text/CSV" as the file source. Navigate to wherever you put the QoG data on your computer.

   ![](img/macos/01a-get-data.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}

   ![](img/macos/01b-get-data.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   On Windows, go to "Get Data" > "From File" > "From Text/CSV" and navigate to wherever you put the QoG data on your computer.

   ![](img/windows/01-get-data.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

3. Excel will load a preview of the data into a window. Don't actually click on the "Load" button in that window though. You need to tell Excel which columns/rows to import first. Click on the "Transform Data" button instead:

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/02-transform.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/02-transform.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

4. The Power Query Editor should open, which lets you select and filter and manipulate the data before importing it to Excel. Click on the "Choose Columns" button to select which columns to keep.

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/03-choose-columns.png){width="90%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/03-choose-columns.png){width="90%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

   You'll definitely want to keep the country name (`cname`) and year (`year`) columns. The list of columns only shows the first 1,000 columns, so if you're interested in a column that comes later in the alphabet (like `wgov_totmil`, which we're working with in the example here), you won't be able to select it here (or even search for it!). Instead, select some other column, and we can adjust it later.

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/04-col-select.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/04-col-select.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

   After you've selected those columns, you can adjust the underlying code for the query and select the column(s) you actually care about. Here I changed the random `aid_cpsc` column to `wgov_totmil`:

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/05-query-adjust.png){width="90%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/05-query-adjust.png){width="90%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

5. If you want, you can also filter the rows that you import. For this assignment you're working with (at least) five countries over (at least) ten years. You can click on the little dropdown menu in the column headings to specify different filters, like specific countries or a range of years. 

   You can also import all the rows and do this kind of filtering later in Excel itself. Either way is fine.

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/06-query-filter.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/06-query-filter.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

6. Click on the "Close & load" button to import the subset of data into your Excel workbook.

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/07-query-done.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/07-query-done.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

7. You should now have a (much!) smaller version of the QoG data in Excel!

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/08-query-in-excel.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/08-query-in-excel.png){width="90%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

### Filter the data in Excel

Excel has the ability to filter data based on all sorts of different conditions (exact name matches, being less than or greater than some value, etc.) using dropdown menus in the column headers. If you didn't filter the data when importing it, you can filter it in Excel.

::: {.callout-tip}
#### Enabling filtering

The data that you import from QoG should already be set up for filtering—you can tell because there are little dropdown menus at the top of each column. If you're working with other data that doesn't already have those dropbown menus, you can add them by going to the "Data" tab in the menu ribbon and then clicking on "Filter".
:::

You can filter the country column by checking the boxes next to whichever countries you want to include.

::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
#### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

![](img/macos/09-filter-country.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}

#### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

![](img/windows/09-filter-country.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}
:::

You can filter the year column by checking the boxes for each year, or by creating a range, like `2008 ≥ year < 2022` here. (You shouldn't necessarily use that exact range in your assignment! That's just an example here! Use whatever range you're interested in!)

::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
#### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

![](img/macos/10-filter-year.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}

#### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

![](img/windows/10-filter-year.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}
:::

### Plot the data in Excel

Now that you have a nice clean and filtered subset of data, you need to plot it! We want to create a plot that shows trends in this indicator over time, with a line per country. We can do this in Excel by building the plot up a country at a time.

1. Select only the governance indicator values for the first country:

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/11-select-data.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/11-select-data.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

2. In the "Insert" tab in the menu ribbon, insert a line chart:

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/12-insert-chart.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/12-insert-chart.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

3. You'll get a chart with the indicator values over time (yay!), but it's not great (boo!). The x-axis has numbers instead of years, and there's no legend showing what country this line represents.

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/13-initial-chart.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/13-initial-chart.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

4. Add year labels to the x-axis by right clicking on the chart and choosing "Select Data…"

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/14-select-data.png){width="65%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/14-select-data.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

   Use the "Horizontal (Category) Axis Labels" section to select the years from the data:

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/15-select-years.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/15a-select-years.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" .border}
   
   ![](img/windows/15b-select-years.png){width="60%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

5. Add a legend by going to the "Chart Design" tab in the menu ribbon and using the "Add Chart Element" menu:

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/16-add-legend.png){width="50%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/16-add-legend.png){width="40%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

6. Your chart should now have years on the x-axis and a legend:

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/17-partial-chart.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/17-partial-chart.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

7. The legend, though, isn't great. It says "Series1" instead of the name of the country. We can fix that by right clicking on the chart and choosing "Select Data…". In the settings for the data series, point the "Name" field to one of the cells in the data:

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/18-series-name.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/18a-series-name.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}

   ![](img/windows/18b-series-name.png){width="60%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

8. Your chart should now have a nicer legend:

   ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
   #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

   ![](img/macos/19-partial-chart.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}

   #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

   ![](img/windows/19-partial-chart.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}
   :::

9. Great! We have a chart for one country! 

10. To add the next country, right click on the chart and choose "Select Data…". Add a new series and select the next country's indicator values (and change the name of the series accordingly, like earlier):

    ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
    #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

    ![](img/macos/20-new-series.png){width="90%" fig-align="center" .border}

    #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

    ![](img/windows/20a-new-series.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" .border}

    ![](img/windows/20b-new-series.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" .border}
    :::

11. There are now two countries in the chart, each with a legend:

    ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
    #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

    ![](img/macos/21-partial-chart.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}

    #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

    ![](img/windows/21-partial-chart.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}
    :::

12. Repeat the same process for all the other countries you want to add:

    1. Right click and choose "Select Data…"
    2. Add a new series for the range of data you care about
    3. Change the series name

    ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
    #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

    ![](img/macos/22-final-series.png){width="65%" fig-align="center" .border}

    #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

    ![](img/windows/22-final-series.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}
    :::

13. We can add a title to give the chart more context. Go to the "Chart Design" tab in the menu ribbon and use the "Add Chart Element" menu:

    ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
    #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

    ![](img/macos/23-add-title.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}

    #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

    ![](img/windows/23-add-title.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}
    :::

14. All done!

    ::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
    #### {{< fa brands apple >}} macOS

    ![](img/macos/24-final-chart.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}

    #### {{< fa brands windows >}} Windows

    ![](img/windows/24-final-chart.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .border}

## Plotting QoG data with R

Since the QoG data is already structured for statistical software, you can do all this importing and plotting work a lot faster if you know R.

Here's a quick example of how (this assumes you're familiar with R):

```{r}
#| label: r-example
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-width: 5.5
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 70%

library(tidyverse)

# The {rqog} package lets you download data directly from the QoG project
# remotes::install_github("ropengov/rqog")  # Install the package from GitHub
library(rqog)

# Get the standard time series data from QoG
qog_standard <- read_qog(
  which_data = "standard", 
  data_type = "time-series", 
  data_dir = "temp"
)

# Select just some columns, countries, and years
qog_subset <- qog_standard |> 
  select(cname, year, wgov_totmil) |> 
  filter(cname %in% c("Afghanistan", "Algeria", "Australia", "Austria")) |> 
  filter(year >= 2008, year <= 2021)

# Look at the first few rows
head(qog_subset)

# Plot the data
ggplot(
  data = qog_subset,
  mapping = aes(x = year, y = wgov_totmil, color = cname)
) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Government officials with military title", color = NULL) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Plotting QoG data with Stata

Since the QoG data is already structured for statistical software, you can do all this importing and plotting work a lot faster if you know Stata.

Here's a quick example of how (this assumes you're familiar with Stata):


```stata
// There's no automatic way to get QoG data into Stata like with R, so download 
// the standard time series Stata file from the QoG website first
use "qog_std_ts_jan24_stata14.dta", clear

// Select just some columns, countries, and years
keep cname year wgov_totmil
keep if year >= 2008 & year <= 2021
keep if inlist(cname, "Afghanistan", "Algeria", "Australia", "Austria")

// Look at the first few rows
list in 1/8
```

```default
   +-------------------------------+
   |       cname   year   wgov_t~l |
   |-------------------------------|
1. | Afghanistan   2008          2 |
2. | Afghanistan   2009          2 |
3. | Afghanistan   2010          1 |
4. | Afghanistan   2011          2 |
5. | Afghanistan   2012          2 |
   |-------------------------------|
6. | Afghanistan   2013          1 |
7. | Afghanistan   2014          1 |
8. | Afghanistan   2015          2 |
   +-------------------------------+
```

```stata
// Plot the data
twoway (line wgov_totmil year if cname == "Afghanistan", mcolor(black)) ///
       (line wgov_totmil year if cname == "Algeria", mcolor(blue)) ///
	   (line wgov_totmil year if cname == "Australia", mcolor(red)) ///
	   (line wgov_totmil year if cname == "Austria", mcolor(orange)), ///
	   ytitle("Government officials with military title") xtitle("Year") ///
	   legend(rows(1) position(6) order(1 "Afghanistan" 2 "Algeria" 3 "Australia" 4 "Austria"))
```
